Hi! I'm Atmois and I do a lot of random things all over the place! Most of it you can see on my [website](https://atmois.com)! I don't use GitHub much for my own projects anymore, most of which you can find most my repo's on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Atmois) or you can see the work I do for All Things Linux on their [organisation](https://github.com/AllThingsLinux) or on the All Things Linux wiki, [atl.wiki](https://atl.wiki)!
